# ARHS_core

ARHS [Augmented Reality Headset System] is an augmented reality project aiming to use existing hardware to produce a low cost and flexible platform for on-the-go computer vision.

This repository hosts the code for ARHS-core, which is the code used by the headset and hence "core" part of the system.

You'll need opencv and hidapi if you want to test it out.
